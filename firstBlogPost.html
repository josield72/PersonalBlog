      <p class="description">Hi friends! This is my update for 8/4/22. This past week has been quite uneventful. We have a family reunion coming up this weekend, so lots of cleaning has been taking place around my house. Nellie likes to "help" with cleaning (AKA get in the way). I went through our pictures again from our last Disneyland trip, and found this adorable one of her on It's a Small World. She looks so happy, look in her eyes!</p>
